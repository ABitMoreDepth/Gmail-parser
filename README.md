Gmail-parser
============

Returns simple strings for each unread mail in your gmail (or any IMAP) account

REQUIRED: IMAPLIB, sys

USAGE: python gmail_checker.py $Username $Password

Currently quite  basic, at the moment it has hardly any error handling or comments, and is probably not particularly efficient...

(I'mm new to all this, improvements welcome - so long as I can make sense of them!)

Cheers,
