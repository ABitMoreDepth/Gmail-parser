Gmail-parser - dev_UTF-Handler
============

Branch to work on UTF handling for the subject lines.
Mostly to do with learning about branches


Returns simple strings for each unread mail in your gmail (or any IMAP) account

REQUIRED: IMAPLIB, sys

USAGE: python gmail_checker.py $Username $Password

Currently quite  basic, at the moment it has hardly any error handling or comments, and is probably not particularly efficient...

(I'mm new to all this, improvements welcome - so long as I can make sense of them!)

Cheers,

S
